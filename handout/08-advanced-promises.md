# Part 8: More Promises

Now that we've got our code better organized using services, we can look at
some of the more interesting things we can do with promises.

## Reusing Promises

```javascript
  var taskPromise;
  service.getTasks = function () {
    taskPromise = taskPromise || server.get('/api/v1/tasks');
    return taskPromise;
  };
```

## Postponing the Requests

```javascript
  .factory('server', function($http, user, API_BASE_URL) {
    var service = {};

    service.get = function (path) {
      return user.whenAuthenticated()
        .then(function() {
          return $http.get(API_BASE_URL + path);
        })
        .then(function(response) {
          return response.data;
        });
    };

    return service;
  });
```

## A Brand New Promise

Suppose we have a function that uses callbacks. We have a few options for
turning it into a function that returns a promise.

The first approach is to use `$q.defer()`:

```javascript
  function getFooPromise(param) {
    var deferred = $q.defer();
    getFooWithCallbacks(param, function(error, result) {
      if (error) {
        deferred.reject(error);
      } else {
        deferred.resolve(result);
      }
    });
    return deferred.promise;
  }
```

An alternative is to use the ES6-style constructor:

```js
  function getFooPromise(name) {
    return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
      getFooWithCallbacks(param, function(error, result) {
        if (error) {
          reject(error);
        } else {
          resolve(result);
        }
      });
    });
  }
```

This latter approach is less common today but is worth adopting since it is
closer to the native promise creation in ES6.

However, beware of a very common JavaScript antipattern that involves
unnecessary creation of new promises. This often goes by the name of "Deferred
Antipatern", but it applies equally to the ES6-style promise constructor. In
most cases, you do not need to create new promises from scratch and resolve
them yourself. If you got a promise from another function, you should use that
promise's `.then()` method to create further promises. It is almost never a
good idea to create a manually resolve a promise inside of a promise callback.

Converting a callback-style function to one returning a promise is about the
only valid case for using a promise constructor. Even in this case, however,
the result can be better achieved using a dedicated conversion function. For
example, if you have a function that relies on Node-style callbacks as in the
example above above, you can convert it using
[angular-promisify](https://github.com/rangle/angular-promisify) like so:

```js
  var getFooPromise = denodeify(getFooWithCallbacks);
```

While manually resolving promises is rarely a good idea, `$q` offers two
promise-creation methods that often come in very handy. You can use
`$q.when(value)` to create a promise that resolves to `value` and
`$q.reject(error)` to create a promise that rejects with `error`. Use those
methods when you want to avoid calling a function that would have given you
a promise.

```javascript
  service.get = function (path) {
    if (!networkInformation.isOnline) {
      return $q.reject('offline');
    } else {
      return user.whenAuthenticated()
        .then(function() {
          return $http.get(API_BASE_URL + path);
        })
        .then(function(response) {
          return response.data;
        });
    }
  };
```

Or, better yet:

```javascript

  function waitForPreconditions() {
    if (!networkInformation.isOnline) {
      return $q.reject('offline');
    } else {
      return user.whenAuthenticated();
    }
  }

  service.get = function (path) {
    return waitForPreconditions()
      .then(function() {
        return $http.get(API_BASE_URL + path);
      })
      .then(function(response) {
        return response.data;
      });
    }
  };
```

## Promises from `$timeout()`

Angular's `$timeout()` service also returns a promise. The same is true for a
number of other AngularJS functions.

## Promises vs Events

While promises are nearly always better than Node- style callbacks, the choice
of when to use promises vs a publish-subscribe approach (e.g., via
`$broadcast`) is a bit more complex. Here are the key differences between the
two approaches:

| Promises                           | Events (aka “Publish – Subscribe”) |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Things that happen ONCE            | Things that happen MANY TIMES      |
| Same treatment for past and future | Only care about the future*        |
| Easily matched with requests       | Detached from requests             |

Promises are often the best approach for handling responses to an explicit
request, such as an HTTP call. Publish-subscribe often works better for
handling actions initiated by the user (except with modals).

## Next Steps

We now know most of what we need to know about services. Before we write more
service code, however, we need to get setup for unit testing.
